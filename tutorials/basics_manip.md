# 1. Familiarise with the dataset

Every data scientist has a specific workflow to carry out a project: importing, cleaning, analysing dataset(s) and presenting an output, usually through a visual medium. **80% of our work consists of cleaning and preparing the datasets for analysis and modelling**. As you can imagine, raw datasets come in all shapes and forms, and that is way it takes way more time and effort to clean them, sort them, create new variables, than carrying out the analysis and reporting. 

![datascience_workflow](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/datascience_workflow.png)

**In this tutorial we are going to learn how to carry out some basic data manipulation with SAS.**

Once you have your data imported on your programming interface, the first thing you need to do is to familiarise with the dataset or series of datasets you are working with. 

You should have your datasets uploaded and imported on SAS 
Studio. If you haven't got them yet, you can download them 
by clicking on the button below. 

<center>
    <form action="AD">
        <a href="/terna_data/terna_data.zip"><input type="button" value="DOWNLOAD THE FILE"></a>
    </form>
</center>

You should first extract the files within the zip folder, then upload them on SAS Studio. The files come in three formats, and you might want to check out the tutorial on [data access](/tutorials/accessing_data.html), to learn how to **import them on SAS Studio**.

I am going to assume you have the 6 datasets ready to work with.

![imported_data](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/screen_imported_data.png)

You can make sure that all datasets have been temporarily stored inside the *work* library, with the name you've given. I have called the datasets *ternaN* where N stands for the years 2016 until 2021 (the most recent observation). 

Once you've headed to the library, you can also check the content of each dataset. For instance, open the dropdown menu from Terna16. 

![dropdown](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/dropdown_work.png)

Each variable is accompanied by a symbol which already **gives you information on the format of the variable**. You can see most variables are numeric except *date*, which is datetime format. 

We can also quickly explore the datasets by executing two procedures: **proc contents** and **proc print**. 

<a name="subsect1"></a>

## PROC CONTENTS 

Copy the following in a new SAS program (call the program *tutorial_basic_manip.sas*, if you wish to keep it in the future). 

```
/*Executing proc contents on the datasets*/

proc contents data=work.terna16;
proc contents data=work.terna17;
proc contents data=work.terna18;
proc contents data=work.terna19;
proc contents data=work.terna20;
proc contents data=work.terna21;
run;
```

With this code we are repeating the same thing: we want to know **information on the contents of each data set**. In this case, **it is sufficient to run the procedures once**.

Let's use again terna16 as an example - we have repeated the same procedure on all datasets so showing you one of the results is enough. 

![proc_contents_terna16](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/proc_cont_terna16.png)

The proc contents statement gives us a nice overview about the dataset. We are provided with three tables, which you've already explore in the [data access](accessing_data.html) tutorial. 
 
* **dataset description**, including: dataset name and the library it is contained within, n of observations, of variables and the maximum length allowed for a data value; 
* **Engine/host dependent information**: information about how SAS Studio stores and outputs the dataset; 
* **Alphabetic List of Variables and Attributes**: as the title explains, it gives a more in depth overview of the variables contained inside the dataset. 

**SPIEGARE DI PIU' SUL PROC CONTENTS:** 
* LABEL 
* ALTRE OPTIONS NEL PROC CONTENTS PER RENDERE IL TUTTO PIU' INFORMATIVO

<a name="subsect2"></a>

## PROC PRINT 

Another useful thing to do when getting to know the dataset is to print out its raw data. 

```
/* proc print */ 

proc print data=work.terna16; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna17; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna18; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna19; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna20; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna21; 
run; 
```

Again, the code repeats equally for all datasets. However, if you ran it, you would get the **entire dataset printed in the results tab**. 

We could scroll down to see every single row for each dataset, or we could just tell SAS to **print the top 10 and bottom 10 observations**.

To do so, **copy** the following code: 

```
/* First 10 obs */

proc print data = work.terna16 (obs = 10);
run;

/* Last 10 obs */

data last10;
  do p=max(1,nobs-9) to nobs;
    set work.terna16 nobs=nobs point=p;
    output;
  end;
  stop;
run;

proc print data = work.last10;
run;
```

# Data formatting 

Before getting to the actual manipulation of the datasets, you always need to **observe the characteristics of the variables and observations inside each dataset**. 

This way, you can start getting a general **overview** of them, and see if any **formatting changes** need to be made. 

We know that variables can be formatted as either of these three ways:  

1. Numeric 
2. Character string 
3. Datetime

SAS reads *numeric data* by default. However, it is necessary to **add specifications** to make SAS read particular types of **numerical** data as well as **other data formats** (or *types*). 


<a href="subsect3"></a>

## FORMAT and INFORMAT in the DATA STEP

Do you recall the concept of format and informat statements from [accessing data](tutorials/../accessing_data.html)?

Informats and formats present the same formatting specifications. However, **they are used for very different purposes**. The **informat** statement enables SAS to read a non-standard variable, while the **format** statement allows SAS to display the same variable when printed to the output window or viewed in a viewtable window. This implies that **before the format statement there always needs to be an informat**. In fact, printing an output without having *_in_formatted the data* first will not display anything because SAS has not been able to read and interpret it. 

![in-format workflow](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/in-format-workflow.png)

The syntax does not vary between formats and informats, and it is generally presented as

**(IN)FORMAT*w.d***

where

* *(IN)FORMAT* represents the name of the format or informat; 
* *w.* refers to the **character** length to be specified, if not the default specific to that (in)format applies;
* *d* refers to the **number of decimal points to be included**. This is specific to the numeric format, and to some of the *date* formats and informats (in that case relating to *fraction of seconds*).
* **REMEMBER** that *informats* are not always necessary, they need to be used only in certain cases (when SAS cannot understand the original formatting type).

Let's explore examples of typical formats by **category**. We will then use some of them to better format our datasets. 

### Numeric (in)formatting 

This table summarises a few of the most common formats and informats used for numeric values.

| Syntax | Definition | Width range | Default width |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| *w.d* | Reads standard numeric data | 1-32 | None |
| BZ*w.d* | Converts blanks to 0s | 1-32 | 1 | 
| COMMA*w.d* | Removes embedded comma and/or $ , converts *left parenthesis* to a *minus sign* |1-32 | 1 | 
| PERCENT*w.* | Converts *percentage* to a *proportion* | 1-32 | 6 |
| DOLLAR*w.d* | Turns the number into *currency*, by inserting the *$* in front of the value | 2-32 | 6 | 
| WORDS*w.d* | Converts the numeric value to *written* (string) *format* | 5â€“32767 | 10 |

As you can see from running our last piece of code, the values in the datasets are mostly numeric, but present way too many decimals to be read easily. Some formatting is required. 

```
/* Numeric data formatting: setting number of decimal places */

data terna16_formatted; 
set work.terna16;
format Biomass 5.2 Wind 5.2 Geothermal 5.2 Hydro 5.2 Photovoltaic 5.2;
run;
```

Let's have a look at the code written. 

* There is a new statement: **set**, allowing you to create a new dataset from the copy of an already existing one. In our case, we have copied the dataset *terna16* to create a new one *terna16_formatted*, with the changes made on the format of the numeric variables.
* As we said earlier, in this case **we don't need to specify the informat** - SAS does recognise the numeric format, and the **format** statement is enough to change the number of decimal places. 
* To format the variables we have specified the *w.d* options mentioned before. The *w.* relates to the **total character length set for the value** which we set to 5, while the *d* refers to the number of decimal places allowed, or 2 in our case.

You can see the difference between the formatted numeric values and the original format below. 

![numeric_formatting](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/numeric_formatting.png)

Also check what happens if we only wrote an *informat statement*, instead of the format. 

```
/* Numeric data formatting: setting number of decimal places */

data terna16_formatted; 
set work.terna16;
informat Biomass 5.2 Wind 5.2 Geothermal 5.2 Hydro 5.2 Photovoltaic 5.2;
run;
```

![wrong_informat-numeric](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/wrong_informat-numeric.png)

What has changed? *Nothing*! **The informat does not work as it does not find any value to transform in order to make it compatible with SAS**. 

### Datetime (in)formatting 

This table shows a few common examples of (in)formatting types used for date-time values.

| Syntax | Definition | Width range | Default width |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| DATE*w.* | Reads dates in forms *ddmmyyyy* and *ddmmyy* | 7-32 | 7 | 
| DATETIME*w.* | Reads datetime values in the form: *ddmmyy hh:mm:ss:ss* | 13-40 | 18 |
| TIME*w.d* | Reads time in form: *hh:mm:ss:ss* (or *hh:mm*) using a 24-h clock | 5-32 | 8 |
| DDMMYY*w.* | Reads date values in the form *ddmmyy* or *ddmmyyyy* | 2-10 | 8 |
| MONYY*w.* | Reads month and yer date values in the form *mmmyy* or *mmmyyyy* | 5-7 | 5 |
| YYQ*w.* | Reads *quarters* of the year | 4-32 | 6 |

In our datasets, two are date-time variables: *year* and *date*. If you go back to the results from the PROC CONTENTS, you can see that the variable **date** is correctly seen as a date, formatted as *MMDDYY10.*, while **year** is considered a numeric variable just like the other ones. 

![original_datetime_format](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/date-year-format-original.png)

We can play around with the two variables to see how they change as we change their format. 

Let's have a look at the *date* variable -- if you remember the proc contents, it identifies the data type as numeric but outputs a string-like variable like a date value. 

Let's try and print out the format with month written in words, not in numbers. 

```
/* Date formatting -- DATE9. */

data terna16_formatted1; 
set work.terna16_formatted; 
informat date mmddyyyy10.;
format date date9.;
run; 

proc print data=work.terna16_formatted1 (obs=10); 
run; 

proc contents data=work.terna16_formatted1;run;
```

You can see that compared to earlier, we have **switched the order of day and month values** and we have also **turned the month to a worded format**.

![date9 format](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/date_format_date9.png)

You can see the contents have changed too, but not the data type, which is still *numeric*. Remember that this happens because **SAS does not present a built-in recognition for dates**, but only for numeric and character-like data.

![data type num for dates](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/format_numeric_for_dates.png)

Let's try and take this dataset and **remove the day part of the date**. We can do this with the *MONYY* format.

```
/* Date formatting -- MONYY */

data terna16_formatted2; 
set work.terna16_formatted1; 
informat date ddmmyyyy10.; 
format date monyy7.; 
run;  

proc print data=work.terna16_formatted1 (obs=10); 
run; 
```

Let's break the code down.
* The **set statement** takes the information from an already existing dataset - in this case we are simply *overwriting* the previously created dataset called *terna16_formatted*.
* **informat date ddmmyyyy10.**
  * *informat* initiates the informat statement;
  * *date* is the variable name which needs to be informatted;
  * *ddmmyyyy10.* is the informat used, to **match the original formatting** - in this way SAS is able to read the initial way in which the values are formatted;
* **format date monyy7.**
  * *format* initiates the format statement; 
  * *date* is the variable name which needs to be formatted after the informat; 
  * *monyy7.* is the final formatting which is going to be displayed. 

This is what your result should look like, compared to the original dataset without the *date* variable formatted to MON-YY: 

![date_formatting](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/date_formatting.png)

We could have also chosen to display the date with the year showing only two digits - like so: 

```
/* Date formatting -- 2-digit year */


data terna16_formatted2; 
set work.terna16_formatted1; 
informat date ddmmyyyy10.; 
format date monyy5.;
run; 

proc print data=work.terna16_formatted2 (obs=10); 
run; 
```

![year_2-digit](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/date_formatting_2digit.png)

Now, if we wanted to change the format of the *year* variable, we could use the following code. Paste it in your SAS program. 

```
/* Formatting the year variable */

data terna16_year; 
set work.terna16_formatted1; 
format year yyyy4.; 
run; 
proc print data=work.terna16_year (obs = 10);
run; 
```

With this code we are: 
* taking the variables from *terna16_formatted1* dataset, which, remember, contains the *date* variable formatted as mon-yyyy; 
* using **yyyy4.** to specify that the *year* variable is a date variable, specifically the year value which must be maximum *4 characters long*; 
* printing the first 10 observations of the new dataset *terna16_year*.

The result should look like this. 

![formatting year](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/formatting%20the%20year%20variable.png)

From the output you don't see any difference, which is normal because we haven't told SAS to change the length of the variable, **we have only specified that it is a year (date-time) type of value**. You can actually see the difference when running the PROC CONTENTS on the data set. 

```
proc contents data=work.terna16_year; 
run; 
```

This is the output. 

![contents_formatted](../screenshots/04_basic_manip/proc_contents-formatted.png)

In that same table you can actually see all the formatting modifications we have applied to the dataset: 
* The numeric variables present the maxmimum character length of 5 and the 2 decimal places; 
* The *date* variable has the informat equal to *DDMMYY10.* and the format (displayed) as *MON-YY7.*; 
* The *year* variable has the format as *YYYY4.*. 

We can compare the two tables from the contents procedure **before** and **after** formatting, to see the difference. 

/* comparison before and after formatting - proc contents */

proc contents data=work.terna16 (obs=10); 
proc contents data=work.terna16_year (obs=10);
run; 

Check out the results below. 

![comparing_contents](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/comparing_formats-date.png)

### String (in)formatting 

This table shows a few common examples of (in)formatting types used for string type values.

| Syntax | Definition | Width range | Default width |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| $*w.* | Reads character data and *trims leading blanks* | 1â€“32,767 | None |
| $CHAR*w.* | Reads character data but *does not trim* leading or trailing blanks | 1â€“32,767 | 8 or length of var | 
| $UPCASE*w.* | Converts character data to *upcase* | 1â€“32,767 | 8 | 
| $QUOTE*w.* | Removes *matching quotation marks* from character data | 2 if var length undefined, otherwise length of var + 2 | 2â€“32767 |
| $REVERS*w.* | Reads character data *from right to left and left aligns*, removes *blanks* | 1 if width of output field not specified | 1â€“32767 | 
| $VARYING*w.* | Reads character data of *varying length* | Default length of variable; 8 if variable is undefined | 1â€“32767 | 

Let's see an example with our dataset, to work with string formatting.

As it is, the dataset doesn't present any string-like variables. We can create a new variable so that we can practice with this type of format. 

```
/* Creating a new variable containing the name of the dataset */ 

data terna16_newvar; 
set work.terna16_year;
dataset_name = "Terna 2016";
run;

proc print data=work.terna16_newvar (obs=10);
run;
```

Let's understand the code: 
* Remember that **set** *copies* the information or part of it from an already existing dataset to a new one. 
* When copying a dataset with the set statement, you also have the possibility to *add new variables* - whether they are calculated fields, string values, date values, etc. In our case we are creating a new variable called *dataset_name*, which is going to print a constant string value: *Terna 2016*.

You can see the dataset now presents this addition by printing it (proc print) and having a look at the results tab. 

![char var](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/character_var.png)

Okay, now we can start formatting the data. First we can set the informats and formats to be of a specified character data type.

```
/* proc contents data=work.terna16_newvar;
run; */

data terna16_newvar_formatted; 
set work.terna16_newvar;
informat dataset_name $CHAR10.;
format dataset_name $CHAR10.; 
run; 
```

We haven't changed the length of the variable while setting formats and informats and that is why we don't see any difference in the resulting dataset.

![char_var_formatted](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_formatted.png)

In this case we can only see the difference when running a PROC CONTENTS. 

![char var cont](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_contents.png)

You can see the difference between proc contents a) and b).
* A) The PROC CONTENTS shows the dataset before formatting and we can see that SAS recognises the variable *dataset_name* is character variable of length 10; 
* B) The PROC CONTENTS shows the dataset after formatting and we can see the formatting and informatting specified as $CHAR10. variable.

Let's see what happens if we tried to change the character length of the variable.

```
/* Formatting with smaller character length */

data terna16_newvar_formatted5; 
set work.terna16_newvar;
informat dataset_name $CHAR5.;
format dataset_name $CHAR5.; 
run; 
```

We have reduced the maximum character length allowed for the variable from 10 to 5. In this way, the string we have input earlier is cut only showing the word *"Terna"* out of the entire string.

![char_var_length](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_length.png)

If we set the character length to be *7*, for example, we would start to see part of the next "word" (in our case the year 2016). 

![char_var_length7](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_length7.png)

For this reason, remember to format **a reasonable character length** according to the type of string value you want to display.

Let's do another formatting example. Say we want to set all values for the string variable to be upcase. This is very simple to do with the *$UPCASE.* formatting specification. 

Paste this code in your program. 

```
/* Format string data type to be UPCASE*/

data terna16_newvar_upcase; 
set work.terna16_newvar;
informat dataset_name $UPCASE10.;
format dataset_name $UPCASE10.; 
run; 

proc print data=work.terna16_newvar_upcase (obs=10);
run;
```

The characters of the string have effectively been converted to upcase. 

![char_var_upcase](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_UPCASE.png)

And we can verify the change in format with the PROC CONTENTS. 

![char_var_cont](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/char_var_upcase_contents.png)

<a href="subsect4"></a>

## PROC FORMAT

There is another method to define formats and informats, and that is with the **PROC FORMAT**. PROC FORMAT is a procedure creating a mapping of data values into **data labels**, thus formats and informats that can later be **explicitly assigned** to a dataset. 

Therefore, with the PROC FORMAT we can create customised formats and informats that we can store in a library to use whenever it is needed. A very useful tool with a vast range of applications of which we are going to explore a few. 

Generally, this is the syntax of a PROC FORMAT for creating a *format*:  

```
PROC FORMAT; 
VALUE Format_Name 
                  Range1 = 'Label1'
                  Range2 = 'Label2'
                  Range3 = 'Label3'
                  ...
                  ...;
RUN; 
```

While this is the syntax for creating an *informat*: 

```
PROC FORMAT; 
INVALUE Format_Name  
                  Range1 = 'Label1'
                  Range2 = 'Label2'
                  Range3 = 'Label3'
                  ...
                  ...; 
RUN; 
```

The main difference between the two is that to define a format a **VALUE** statement needs to be specified, while to define an informat an **INVALUE** statement is appropriate.

Let's break down the syntax: 
* *PROC FORMAT* calls the procedure step;
* *VALUE* or *INVALUE* determines whether it is a format or informat that is being defined; 
* *Format_Name* is the name of the format or informat that is being defined:
  * For character values, first character must be a *$* sign, and a *letter* or *underscore* as the second character;
  * For numeric values, the name must have a *letter* or *underscore* as the first character;
  * The name *cannot end with a number*;
  * It *cannot have the same name as an exisitng SAS format*;
  * It *should not end with a period in the VALUE statement*;
* *Range1,Range2,...* is the value(s) to which a label is assigned. This can be a **single value, ranges of values or lists of values** for a single label;
* *'Labeln'* is the label that reflects a specific value or range of values:
  * Labels do not require enclosing in single or double quotes;
  * Can be up to 32,767 characters in length;
* *RUN* ends and runs the above procedure, although it is not fundamental but *always good practice* to write it at the end of a step.

Let's put this into practice. We can first create a format to group the amount of energy produced by each renewable energy source. 

Paste the following code in your SAS program. We are defining a proc format that subdivides various *ranges of energy generated*.

```
/* Creating format for grouping amount of energy generated */ 

proc format;
value generation 
  0.0 -< 0.5 = "Up to 0.5 GWh"
  0.5 -< 1.0 = "Between 0.5 and 1.0 GWh"
  1.0 -< 2.0 = "Between 1.0 and 2.0 GWh"
  2.0 -< 4.0 = "Between 2.0 and 4.0 GWh"
  4.0 -< 6.0 = "Between 4.0 and 6.0 GWh"
  6.0 - high = "Greater than 6.0 GWh";
run; 
```

Note that to specify the maximum value of the range you need to write *high* on the right-hand side of the range, while if you wanted to write the minimum value of the range you would need to write *low* at the left-hand side of the range.

To apply the format we need to use the format statement, specify the variables to format and write next to them the name of the new format with the *period sign* at the end of it. Like so:

```
data terna16_proc_formatted;
set work.terna16_newvar_upcase;
format  Biomass Geothermal Hydro Photovoltaic Wind generation.; 
run; 

proc print data=work.terna16_proc_formatted;
run;
```

Once you've run this code, you can see that the variables describing energy generated for each renewable source have changed according to the labels specified in the proc format. 

![proc format energy](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/proc_format_energy.png)

Make sure you have written *value* as the statement to define a *format*. You can check that it won't work as an *informat* like this: 

```
data terna16_proc_formatted;
set work.terna16_newvar_upcase;
INFORMAT  Biomass Geothermal Hydro Photovoltaic Wind generation.; 
run; 

proc print data=work.terna16_proc_formatted;
run;
```

If you now run the code you will see that nothing has changed in the output - the informat *generation.* has not worked because it does not exist.

![proc format no change - informat](04/../../screenshots/04_basic_manip/proc_format_nochange.png)

For our last example, we are going to categorise our date variable into the four seasons, following the days of solstice and equinox as our ranges for the four labels. Paste the following code into your SAS program: 

```
/* Date values into seasons */ 

proc format; 
value seasons
		'01JAN2016'd-'21MAR2016'd = "Winter"
		'22MAR2016'd-'21JUN2016'd = "Spring"
		'22JUN2016'd-'21SEP2016'd = "Summer" 
		'22SEP2016'd-'21NOV2016'd = "Autumn"
		'22NOV2016'd-'31DEC2016'd = "Winter";
		
data terna16_seasons; 
set work.terna16_proc_formatted; 
format seasons seasons.; 
seasons = date;
run;

proc print data=work.terna16_seasons;
run;
```

We have created a new variable called *seasons* to carry out the formatting on the dataset. This way we don't have to overwrite the date variable and we can look at them side by side.

This is the resulting dataset:
