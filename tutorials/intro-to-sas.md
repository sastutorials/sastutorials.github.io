# 1. Introduction: what is SAS? 

## Origins of SAS

SAS began in the late 60s and early 70s, formerly as a *statistical package* created for allowing analysis of large quantities of agricultural data. In fact, its name originally stood for for Statistical Analysis System. 

Its origins locate to North Carolina State University, founded by Anthony Barr and James Goodnight, where the SAS Institute was later founded and incorporated. 

Over the years, SAS developers included an increasingly larger amount of products designed for a variety of applications, from statistical analusis to aritificial intelligience. Thanks to the new additions and the increased versatility of the product, SAS software grew in popularity and use. 

## Use and applications

Today, SAS is an extremely powerful, general-purpose programming language. 

It is primarily used for **advanced analytics, business intelligience, data management, and predictive analytics.**

SAS has become the undisputed market leader in commercial analytics, offering a huge array of statistical functions for people to **learn quickly**, and provides great **technical support** for troubleshooting. 

## Comparison with other programming languages 

Here we offer a summary comparing advantages and disantavantages of using SAS and other programming languages (SPSS, R, Python).


| | SAS | SPSS | R | Python |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Advantages |  |  |  |   |
|  | high adoption rate (major industries) | high adoption rate (universities) | open-source, community creating libraries and contributing | scalability | 
| | flow-based interface, drag and drop | good user interface, extensive documentation | free | general purpose language | 
| | official support | click & play functionality | early adopter in explanatory and predictive modelling | easy to learn | 
| | handles large datasets| easy coding with "paste" button | easy to connect to data sources, incl. NoSQL and webscraping | good in ML | 
| | SQL integration ("PROC SQL") | official suppport | | big community | 
| | | | | free | 
| Disadvantages | | | | |
| | relatively high cost | relatively high cost | can be slow with big datasets | not as strong in explanatory modelling | 
| | does not provide an interface for non-standard options (need to code) | requires different licenses for different functionalities | steep learning curve | | 
| | slow adapting to new techniques | limited syntax | no official support | no official support | 
| | different programs for visualisation and data mining | slow in handling large datasets | no user interface | no user interface |
