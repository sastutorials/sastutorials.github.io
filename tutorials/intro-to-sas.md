# 1. Introduction: what is SAS? 

<a name="#subsect1"></a>

## Origins of SAS

SAS began in the late 60s and early 70s, formerly as a *statistical package* created for allowing analysis of large quantities of agricultural data. In fact, its name originally stood for for Statistical Analysis System. 

Its origins locate back to North Carolina State University, founded by Anthony Barr and James Goodnight, where the SAS Institute was later founded and incorporated. 

Over the years, SAS developers included an increasingly larger amount of products designed for a variety of applications, from statistical analysis to machine learning. Thanks to the new additions and the increased versatility of the product, SAS grew in popularity and use. 

SAS is considered to be part of the 4th generation of programming languages. It is, in fact, much simpler than its predecessors, like Pascal and C, as it already possesses built-in functions to make programming much easier and user-friendly.

## Where does SAS belong in the hierarchy of programming language generations? 

| Generations | Description | Language (examples) | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| First | Machine language. Collection of binary digits or bits that the computer reads and interprets. | Machine code | 
| Second | Assembly language. Low-level programming language specific to a particular computer architecture (later converted into executable machine code). | Assembly language (ASM), Cobol, Fortran |
| Third | High-level language. Several steps removed from the actual code run on a computer's processor. Easy to read syntax. | C, C++ , Net, Java | 
| Fourth | Advanced upon third-generation programming languages. Higher level of abstraction of the internal computer driver details. Programmer-friendlier, versatile, powerful. | **SAS**, Python, R, SPSS | 
| Fifth | Constraint-based and logic programming languages. Based on problem-solving using constraints given to the program. | OPS5, Mercury |

## Use and applications

Today, SAS is an extremely powerful, general-purpose programming language. 

It is primarily used for carrying out **advanced analytics, business intelligience, data management, and predictive analytics.**

SAS has become the undisputed market leader in commercial analytics, offering a huge array of statistical functions for people to **learn quickly**, and provides great **technical support** for troubleshooting.

## SAS toolkit 

SAS does not come as one unique interface for each of its applications and functionalities, but serves of a variety of tools, each specified on a particular task.

Here is an overlook at the main  ones (there are more!): 

* [SAS/ACCESS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-access.html#documentation) provides data access to a wide extension of data sources and formats. It provides data integration between SAS and third-party databases, to read, write and update data from all types of native databases and platforms you use; 

* [SAS/AF](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasaf-support.html) creates portable, point-and-click applications in a development environment. You have access to SAS Component Language (SCL), too, an object-oriented programming laguage that helps you access and display your data, control interfaces, read and write data to SAS tables and files; 

* [SAS/ASSIST](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-assist-support.html#documentation) is a user-friendly software to the SAS System, providing options for completing tasks without having to write code, for saving programs and running them repetitively and for customising the interface to better suit your needs; 

* [SAS/CONNECT](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-connect-support.html#documentation) is a client/server toolset that establishes connections between networked computers with different operating systems, and offers scalability through panel SAS processing; 

* [SAS/EIS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-eis-support.html#documentation) summarises, integrates and displays information in reports that are easy to access and understand; 

* [SAS/ETS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasets-support.html#documentation) allows creation of models, forecasts, simulations of business processes for improving strategic and tactical business planning; 

* [SAS/FSP](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasfsp-support.html#documentation) allows you to browse and edit contents of SAS datasets, to create new datasets and reports, to edit SAS data views, and to build and customise end-user applications: 

* [SAS/GIS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/gis-support.html) provides an interactive Geographic Information Systems interface within the SAS system. You can view and interact with the data by selecting features and performing actions based on your selections; 

* [SAS/GRAPH](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasgraph-support.html#documentation) is a data visualisation tools, allowing you to create accurate, high-impact visuals; 

* [SAS/ML](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasiml-support.html#documentation) translates mathematical formulas into programs for data analysis, optimisation and matrix computations; 

* [SAS/SECURE](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-secure-support.html#documentation) provides access to industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect data as it passes between platforms or over networks; 

* [SAS/SHARE](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-share-support.html#documentation) allows multiple users to gain simultaneous access to SAS files without using separate remote logins; 

* [SAS/STAT](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-stat-support.html#documentation) provides a comprehensive set of tools for statistical methods and visualisation techniques.

As you might have noticed, **SAS is truly wide and varied** in the range of applications and tools it offers. Now let's move on to more practical stuff! Let's open **SAS Studiio**, a free and open platform for you to practice with SAS.

# SAS studio (OnDemand)

SAS has several programming interfaces where you can **actively write and submit code**. 

* SAS **windowing environment** is the interface that is *part of SAS*; 

* SAS **Enterprise Guide** is a *client application* that runs on your laptop and connects to SAS on a *local or remote server*; 

* SAS **Studio** is a *web-based interface* that connects to SAS on a server. There is no download necessary, and for that *you can use it* on *any computer*. 

* It is also possible to run SAS and its tools on other applications, such as **Jupyter Notebbok**, but this way you **won't have access to some of the programming tools that SAS offers**.

We are going to work on **SAS Studio**, and today we are going to explore its environment and windows.

## What is SAS Studio? 

[SAS Studio](https://www.sas.com/it_it/software/studio.html) is the web browser-based programming environment. You can access existing data files, libraries and prograrms or create your own directly from the web. 

SAS Studio connects to a SAS server, to be able to elaborate SAS commands. This server can be an internal one to the cloud environment, a server in your local environment or a copy of the SAS server in your local machine. 

Once code has been elaborated by the software, the formatted results are returned back to SAS studio. 

Let's start exploring the interface!

## Instructions to Log in

To access SAS Studio, you first need to [**register**](https://www.sas.com/profile/ui/#/create) to create a SAS profile.

Fill in the blanks with your personal information and credentials. 

Once you've done that, and verified your email, you can head to the [log in page](https://welcome.oda.sas.com/login) and enter your email address and password. 

![login_studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80749213/111760465-09c4c480-889f-11eb-8b23-cd20a64691ac.PNG)

When the next window opens, click on SAS Studio so we can start exploring the environment!

![open_studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80749213/111761263-01b95480-88a0-11eb-9ad9-ae192033633e.PNG)

## Exploring the SAS Studio environment

SAS Studio (like any other SAS interface) is equipped with **three main environments**:

1. **Editor**

INSERT IMAGE OF EDITOR HERE 

The editor environment allows you to open all SAS programs in which you can write code.

2. **Log**

INSERT IMAGE OF LOG HERE 

The log environment allows you to read messages and errors related to the code you've submitted. 

3. **Results**

INSERT IMAGE OF RESULTS TAB HERE 

This environment allows you to view the data outputs created by your programs. 

However, unlike the other interfaces, SAS Studio presents **smart features** that ease up your programming efforts, like **code completion, formatting and syntax coloring** features. 

Let's have a look at the other features present in the SAS Studio interface. 

On the left hand side, you'll see different tabs that you can click on. 

* The **Server Files and Folders** tab shows you your "home directory" where you can create new folders where to store data you imported and programs you created. These are permanent and you can move them or delete them as you please. 

INSERT IMG TAB1 

* The **Tasks and Utilities** tab shows you all the built-in features for data analytics, visualisation, statistical testing, etc. You can also add your own and these are going to be stored in the **My Tasks** folder (the first one at the top). 

INSERT IMG ON TAB2

INSERT IMG ON TAB2_APERTO 

* The **Snippets** tab offers you pre-made snippets of code that can come in handy so that you don't have to code entirely from scratch. As you can see in the example, I have clicked on the *Edit a SOURCE Entry* from the list of **Catalogs** inside the **Snippets** folder, and a new program appears with the *code snippet* already written inside of it. You can click on multiple snippets and these will just be added in the same program page. As for the *Tasks and Utilities* tab, you can create your own code snippets which are going to be stored in the **My Snippets** folder.

INSERT IMG SNIPPETS (TAB3)

* The **Libraries** tab shows you all the built-in libraries offered by SAS. Some of them are: 

1. **SASHELP** library offers a large variety of *read-only* datasets; 

INSERT IMG SASHELP LIB HERE

2. **SASUSER** is an empty library initally, where you can *permanently save your datasets; 
   
3. **WORK** another empty library, where you can *store your data temporarily*. It is the default library in which data is stored, unless differently specified. 

* The **File Shortcuts** tab offers you a quicker way to access your files. You can create a new file shortcut by **clicking on the curved arrow** symbol, inserting a shortcut name and the path that leads you to the original file. You can also delete the shortcuts, see their properties and / or refresh the shortcut list when you need to update it. 

INSERT IMG OF SHORTCUT FILES TAB - TAB5_STUDIO
