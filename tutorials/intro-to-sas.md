# 1. Introduction: what is SAS? 

## Origins of SAS

SAS began in the late 60s and early 70s, formerly as a *statistical package* created for allowing analysis of large quantities of agricultural data. In fact, its name originally stood for for Statistical Analysis System. 

Its origins locate back to North Carolina State University, founded by Anthony Barr and James Goodnight, where the SAS Institute was later founded and incorporated. 

Over the years, SAS developers included an increasingly larger amount of products designed for a variety of applications, from statistical analysis to machine learning. Thanks to the new additions and the increased versatility of the product, SAS grew in popularity and use. 

SAS is considered to be part of the 4th generation of programming languages. It is, in fact, much simpler than its predecessors, like Pascal and C, as it already possesses built-in functions to make programming much easier and user-friendly. 

## Where does SAS belong in the hierarchy of programming language generations? 

| Generations | Description | Language (examples) | 
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| First | Machine language. Collection of binary digits or bits that the computer reads and interprets. | Machine code | 
| Second | Assembly language. Low-level programming language specific to a particular computer architecture (later converted into executable machine code). | Assembly language (ASM), Cobol, Fortran |
| Third | High-level language. Several steps removed from the actual code run on a computer's processor. Easy to read syntax. | C, C++ , Net, Java | 
| Fourth | Advanced upon third-generation programming languages. Higher level of abstraction of the internal computer driver details. Programmer-friendlier, versatile, powerful. | **SAS**, Python, R, SPSS | 
| Fifth | Constraint-based and logic programming languages. Based on problem-solving using constraints given to the program. | OPS5, Mercury |

## Use and applications

Today, SAS is an extremely powerful, general-purpose programming language. 

It is primarily used for carrying out **advanced analytics, business intelligience, data management, and predictive analytics.**

SAS has become the undisputed market leader in commercial analytics, offering a huge array of statistical functions for people to **learn quickly**, and provides great **technical support** for troubleshooting. 

## Comparison with other programming languages 

Here we offer a summary on advantages and disantavantages of using SAS compared to other programming languages (SPSS, R and Python).


| | SAS | SPSS | R | Python |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|**Advantages** |  |  |  |   |
|  | high adoption rate (major industries) | high adoption rate (universities) | open-source, community creating libraries and contributing | scalability | 
| | flow-based interface, drag and drop | good user interface, extensive documentation | free | general purpose language | 
| | official support | click & play functionality | early adopter in explanatory and predictive modelling | easy to learn | 
| | handles large datasets| easy coding with "paste" button | easy to connect to data sources, incl. NoSQL and webscraping | good in ML | 
| | SQL integration ("PROC SQL") | official suppport | | big community | 
| | | | | free | 
| **Disadvantages** | | | | |
| | relatively high cost | relatively high cost | can be slow with big datasets | not as strong in explanatory modelling | 
| | does not provide an interface for non-standard options (need to code) | requires different licenses for different functionalities | steep learning curve | | 
| | slow adapting to new techniques | limited syntax | no official support | no official support | 
| | different programs for visualisation and data mining | slow in handling large datasets | no user interface | no user interface | 

## SAS toolkit 

SAS does not come as one unique interface for each of its applications and functionalities, but serves of a variety of tools, each specified on a particular task.

Here is an overlook at the main  ones (there are more!): 

* [SAS/ACCESS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-access.html#documentation) provides data access to a wide extension of data sources and formats. It provides data integration between SAS and third-party databases, to read, write and update data from all types of native databases and platforms you use; 

* [SAS/AF](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasaf-support.html) creates portable, point-and-click applications in a development environment. You have access to SAS Component Language (SCL), too, an object-oriented programming laguage that helps you access and display your data, control interfaces, read and write data to SAS tables and files; 

* [SAS/ASSIST](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-assist-support.html#documentation) is a user-friendly software to the SAS System, providing options for completing tasks without having to write code, for saving programs and running them repetitively and for customising the interface to better suit your needs; 

* [SAS/CONNECT](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-connect-support.html#documentation) is a client/server toolset that establishes connections between networked computers with different operating systems, and offers scalability through panel SAS processing; 

* [SAS/EIS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-eis-support.html#documentation) summarises, integrates and displays information in reports that are easy to access and understand; 

* [SAS/ETS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasets-support.html#documentation) allows creation of models, forecasts, simulations of business processes for improving strategic and tactical business planning; 

* [SAS/FSP](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasfsp-support.html#documentation) allows you to browse and edit contents of SAS datasets, to create new datasets and reports, to edit SAS data views, and to build and customise end-user applications: 

* [SAS/GIS](https://support.sas.com/en/software/gis-support.html) provides an interactive Geographic Information Systems interface within the SAS system. You can view and interact with the data by selecting features and performing actions based on your selections; 

* [SAS/GRAPH](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasgraph-support.html#documentation) is a data visualisation tools, allowing you to create accurate, high-impact visuals; 

* [SAS/ML](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sasiml-support.html#documentation) translates mathematical formulas into programs for data analysis, optimisation and matrix computations; 

* [SAS/SECURE](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-secure-support.html#documentation) provides access to industry-standard encryption algorithms to protect data as it passes between platforms or over networks; 

* [SAS/SHARE](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-share-support.html#documentation) allows multiple users to gain simultaneous access to SAS files without using separate remote logins; 

* [SAS/STAT](https://support.sas.com/en/software/sas-stat-support.html#documentation) provides a comprehensive set of tools for statistical methods and visualisation techniques.

As you might have noticed, **SAS is truly wide and varied** in the range of applications and tools it offers. Now let's move on to more practical stuff! Let's open **SAS Studiio**, a free and open platform for you to practice with SAS.
