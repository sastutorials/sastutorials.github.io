    <h1>1. Create a DataSet from scratch</h1>
    <p>Let's start by creating a dataset with the LIST INPUT procedure</p>
    <p><center><img src="/screenshots/WORK.TEST DIMO.PNG" alt="PROG1.PNG"></center></p>
    <p>Its origins locate back to North Carolina State University, founded by Anthony Barr and James Goodnight, where
        the SAS Institute was later founded and incorporated.</p>
    <p>Over the years, SAS developers included an increasingly larger amount of products designed for a variety of
        applications, from statistical analysis to machine learning. Thanks to the new additions and the increased
        versatility of the product, SAS grew in popularity and use.</p>
    <p>SAS is considered to be part of the 4th generation of programming languages. It is, in fact, much simpler than
        its predecessors, like Pascal and C, as it already possesses built-in functions to make programming much easier
        and user-friendly.</p>
