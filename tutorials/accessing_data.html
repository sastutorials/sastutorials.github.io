<h2 id="origins-of-sas">Origins of SAS</h2>
<p>SAS began in the late 60s and early 70s, formerly as a <em>statistical package</em> created for allowing analysis of large quantities of agricultural data. In fact, its name originally stood for for Statistical Analysis System.</p>
<p>Its origins locate back to North Carolina State University, founded by Anthony Barr and James Goodnight, where the SAS Institute was later founded and incorporated.</p>
<p>Over the years, SAS developers included an increasingly larger amount of products designed for a variety of applications, from statistical analysis to machine learning. Thanks to the new additions and the increased versatility of the product, SAS grew in popularity and use.</p>
<p>SAS is considered to be part of the 4th generation of programming languages. It is, in fact, much simpler than its predecessors, like Pascal and C, as it already possesses built-in functions to make programming much easier and user-friendly.</p>
