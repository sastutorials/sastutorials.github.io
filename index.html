      <h2>About this website</h2>
      <p>Welcome! <br>
        This website has been created to offer you a friendly
        environment where to learn programming with SAS.
        This website is meant for beginners and whoever
        needs to re-fresh their knowledge of SAS. <br>
        We are going to use one sample dataset across the
        various tutorials to help you familiarise with it,
        and make your learning journey easier.</p>

      <h5>Here is what you can expect to gain by following this learning journey with us on SAS!</h5>

      <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
      <p>From this learning journey on SAS programming you are going to become familiar and confident with using SAS Software 
      and one of its programming platforms: SAS Studio. 
      You will learn SAS through structured and organised sections, led by theoretical concepts followed by examples and 
      interactive visualisations. <br>
      You will have the opportunity to follow the tutorial by interactively copying and 
      pasting the code written in each tutorial and doing the programming live simultaneously on 
      your own SAS Studio account. Moreover, you have the chance to practice and test yourself
      on your own with exercises available at the end of each tutorial. Solutions to 
      the exercises are also available for you to check after. <br>
      Finally, you are going to be working with hydrological data, as these reflect available resources of 
      energy. </p>
