            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>Welcome! <br> This website has been created to offer you a friendly environment where to learn programming with SAS. This website is meant for beginners and whoever needs to re-fresh their knowledge of SAS. <br> We are going to use one sample
                dataset across the various tutorials to help you familiarise with it, and make your learning journey easier.</p>

            <h2>WHAT TO EXPECT?</h2>
            <h5>Here is what you can expect to gain by following this learning journey with us on SAS!</h5>
            <p>
                You will learn SAS through structured and organised sections, led by theoretical concepts followed by examples and interactive visualisations. <br> You will have the opportunity to follow the tutorial by interactively copying and pasting
                the code written in each tutorial and doing the programming live simultaneously on your own SAS Studio account. Moreover, you have the chance to practice and test yourself on your own with exercises available at the end of each tutorial.
                Solutions to the exercises are also available for you to check after. <br> Finally, you are going to be working with hydrological data, as these reflect available resources of energy.
