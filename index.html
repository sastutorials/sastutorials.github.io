            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>Welcome! <br> This website has been created to offer you a friendly environment where to learn programming with SAS. This website is meant for beginners and whoever needs to re-fresh their knowledge of SAS. <br> </p>

            <h2>WHAT TO EXPECT?</h2>
            <h5>Here is what you can expect to gain by following this learning journey with us on SAS!</h5>
            <p>
                You will learn SAS by working your way through a series of tutorials, from the basics of SAS 
                to more advanced programming. The tutorials are grouped according to a macro topic, 
                so that it is easier for you to navigate them. Each tutorial covers a specific topic in the programming realm of SAS. <br>
                The tutorials are structured and organised in clear sections, each led by theoretical explanations and followed
                by interactive visualisations and examples, to help you gain a full understanding of the subject matter. <br> 
                <strong>We promise you it won't be boring!</strong> You'll be actively interacting with the tutorials, as 
                you will have the data and code available to program on your own while you follow the tutorial along. We are going to use 
                one sample dataset across the various tutorials to help you familiarise with it, and make your learning journey feel like 
                that of an actual data scientist!<br>
                In addition, you'll have plenty of opportunities to practice and test yourself with solo 
                exercises, available at the end of each tutorial. Solutions to the exercises will also be available for you to check after. <br> 
                We hope you'll enjoy this learning experience, and will fulfill your objective of learning and feeling confident with SAS 
                programming!
            </p>
